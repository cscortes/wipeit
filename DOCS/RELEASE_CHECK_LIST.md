- `TESTDESIGN.md` - Document new tests or testing approaches
- `ARCH.md` - Update architecture documentation if design changed

## Git Operations

### 8. Create Version Tag
Create a Git tag for the new version:
```bash
git tag -a v<VERSION> -m "Release version <VERSION>"
```
Example: `git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release version 1.3.0"`

### 9. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Release version <VERSION>"
```

### 10. Push to Repository

git push origin v<VERSION>
```

## Post-Release

### 11. Build Distribution
Build the distribution packages:
```bash
python -m build
```

### 12. Verify Distribution
- Check that wheel and source distribution were created in `dist/`
- Verify version numbers in distribution filenames match the release version

## Release Complete âœ“

The release process is now complete. Verify that the new version is available in the repository and all documentation is up to date.
