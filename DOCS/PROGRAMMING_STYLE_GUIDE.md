# Programming Style

- All python programs must have a hard length of 79 characters per line.
- All python doc strings must also have a hard length of 79 characters per line.
- keep routines small, by breaking up larger routines into logical/
reusable functions.
- recommend new classes based on functionality,
to dev in the TODO.md as a low priority item.
- Use only doc strings in functions, not inline comments.
