## Buffer Size Cheat Sheet

**üö® USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - ALL DATA WILL BE IRREVERSIBLY DESTROYED! üö®**

### By Device Type

| Device | Buffer Size | Command |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **USB 2.0 Drive** | 100M | `sudo wipeit -b 100M /dev/sdx` |
| **USB 3.0 Drive** | 256M | `sudo wipeit -b 256M /dev/sdx` |
| **SATA HDD** | 500M | `sudo wipeit -b 500M /dev/sdx` |
| **SATA SSD** | 1G | `sudo wipeit -b 1G /dev/sdx` |
| **NVMe SSD** | 2G | `sudo wipeit -b 2G /dev/sdx` |

### By Available RAM

| Your RAM | Maximum Buffer | Safe Buffer |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 512 MB | 100M | 50M |
| 1 GB | 500M | 256M |
| 2 GB | 1G | 500M |
| 4 GB | 2G | 1G |
| 8+ GB | 4G | 2G |

## Pre-Wipe Checklist

```bash
# 1. Identify the correct device
lsblk
sudo wipeit  # List all devices

# 2. Unmount all partitions
sudo umount /dev/sdx*

# 3. Check available RAM
free -h

# 4. Verify device is not busy
lsof /dev/sdx

# 5. Start wipe with appropriate buffer
sudo wipeit -b [SIZE] /dev/sdx
```

## Optimization Commands

### Check Current I/O Scheduler
```bash
cat /sys/block/sdx/queue/scheduler
```

### Set Optimal Scheduler
```bash
# For SSDs
echo none | sudo tee /sys/block/sdx/queue/scheduler

# For HDDs
echo mq-deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/sdx/queue/scheduler
```

### Disable Power Management (if slow)
```bash
sudo hdparm -B 255 /dev/sdx
```

### Monitor Active I/O
```bash
# Install if needed
sudo dnf install iotop  # Fedora
sudo apt install iotop  # Ubuntu

# Monitor
sudo iotop -o
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Speed slower than expected

**Quick fixes:**
```bash
# 1. Increase buffer size
sudo wipeit -b 1G /dev/sdx

# 2. Check for other I/O activity
sudo iotop -o

# 3. Try different USB port (for external drives)

# 4. Verify cable quality
```

### Issue: System running out of memory

**Quick fixes:**
```bash
# 1. Reduce buffer size
sudo wipeit -b 50M /dev/sdx

# 2. Close other applications

# 3. Check memory usage
free -h
```

### Issue: Device overheating

**Quick fixes:**
```bash
# 1. Reduce buffer size to slow down writes
sudo wipeit -b 100M /dev/sdx

# 2. Pause and resume
# Press Ctrl+C to pause
# Wait for device to cool
# Restart with same command
```

## Multiple Devices Strategy

When wiping multiple devices simultaneously, divide your RAM:

```bash
# Example: 8GB RAM, 3 devices = ~2GB per device (leaving 2GB for system)

# Terminal 1
sudo wipeit -b 500M /dev/sdb

# Terminal 2
sudo wipeit -b 500M /dev/sdc

# Terminal 3
sudo wipeit -b 500M /dev/sdd
```

## Monitoring Progress

Watch for these indicators in the progress output:

```
Progress: 15.42% | Written: 19.74 GB | Speed: 82.15 MB/s | ETA: 17.23 min | Buffer: 100M
```

**What to check:**
- **Speed:** Should match expected speed for your device type
- **ETA:** Should be reasonable based on device size
- **Progress:** Should increase steadily

**Red flags:**
- Speed drops significantly (check cable/USB port)
- Progress stalls (check `dmesg` for errors)
- Speed < 10 MB/s on modern devices (device may be failing)

## Emergency Stops

You can safely interrupt at any time:

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
^C
Wipe interrupted.
```

**Note:** Interrupting is safe but:
- Device will be partially wiped
- You'll need to start over for complete wipe
- Already-wiped data is not recoverable

## Performance Testing

To find optimal buffer size for your device:

```bash
# Test with small area (if you have test data)
sudo wipeit -b 100M /dev/sdx  # Note the speed
# Ctrl+C after 1-2 minutes

sudo wipeit -b 500M /dev/sdx  # Note the speed
# Ctrl+C after 1-2 minutes

sudo wipeit -b 1G /dev/sdx    # Note the speed
# Ctrl+C after 1-2 minutes

# Use the buffer size with best speed/memory trade-off
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. ‚úÖ Always verify device path before wiping
2. ‚úÖ Unmount all partitions first
3. ‚úÖ Choose buffer size based on device type and available RAM
4. ‚úÖ Monitor progress for expected speeds
5. ‚úÖ Close unnecessary applications during wipe
6. ‚úÖ Use quality cables for external drives
7. ‚úÖ Allow adequate cooling for devices
8. ‚úÖ Keep total buffer sizes < 50% of RAM for multiple devices

## Quick Syntax Reference

```bash
# Basic wipe (default 100M buffer)
sudo wipeit /dev/sdx

# Custom buffer
sudo wipeit -b [SIZE][M|G|T] /dev/sdx

# List devices only
sudo wipeit

# Help
wipeit --help

# Examples
sudo wipeit -b 500M /dev/sdb    # 500 megabytes
sudo wipeit -b 1G /dev/sdc      # 1 gigabyte
sudo wipeit -b 2G /dev/sdd      # 2 gigabytes
sudo wipeit -b 0.5G /dev/sde    # 512 megabytes (decimal)
```
