## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Auto-Detect Resume Drive**: Major enhancement to `--resume` functionality
  - `--resume` no longer requires device specification
  - Automatically searches all drives and matches by serial number and model
  - Device path (e.g., `/dev/sdb`) can now change between sessions
  - New function `find_device_by_serial_model()` searches and matches drives
  - Maintains backwards compatibility: can still specify device manually
  - Shows clear feedback about which drive was detected
  - Provides helpful error messages when no matching drive is found

### Changed
- **Argument Parser**: Updated help text and examples
  - Device argument is now optional with `--resume`
  - Updated help: "Resume previous wipe session (auto-detects drive by serial number)"
  - Updated examples to show both `wipeit --resume` and `wipeit --resume /dev/sdb`

### Improved
- **User Messages**: Updated all `--resume` instructions throughout the codebase
  - KeyboardInterrupt message now shows auto-detection info
  - Device mismatch errors reference auto-detection
  - Resume prompts clarify no device specification needed

### Tests

  - `test_find_device_by_serial_model_found()` - Successful auto-detection
  - `test_find_device_by_serial_model_not_found()` - No matching device
  - `test_find_device_by_serial_model_no_progress_file()` - Missing progress file
  - `test_find_device_by_serial_model_no_serial_in_progress()` - Missing serial
  - `test_setup_argument_parser_resume_without_device()` - Parser validation

  - `ARCH.md`: Updated function listings, removed obsolete functions, added new utility functions
  - `PROGRAMMING_STYLE_GUIDE.md`: Updated circular dependency example to use DeviceDetector
  - `TESTDESIGN.md`: Updated function names to match current implementation

## [1.4.3] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Random Data Wiping**: Fixed bug where device was being overwritten with zeros instead of random data
  - Changed all wipe operations to use `os.urandom()` for cryptographically secure random data
  - Affects StandardStrategy, AdaptiveStrategy, and DiskPretest
  - Now properly meets security requirements for secure data destruction
  - Impact: Slightly slower due to random data generation, but significantly more secure

### Changed
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved code organization based on human review of AI-generated code

  - Removed unused `timestamp` parameter from PretestResults
  - Removed redundant `analysis` dictionary from PretestResults.to_dict()

### Added

  - Removed redundant tests already covered in test_device_detector.py
  - All 167 tests pass

### Documentation

## [1.4.1] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- **Critical: Progress callbacks never called**: Fixed modulo alignment bug that prevented progress saves
  - Problem: `written % PROGRESS_SAVE_THRESHOLD == 0` fails when chunk sizes don't align (e.g., 1GB chunks vs 100MB threshold: `1073741824 % 104857600 = 62914560 ‚â† 0`)
  - Solution: Added `written_since_last_save` tracking variable
  - Changed condition to `written_since_last_save >= PROGRESS_SAVE_THRESHOLD`
  - Ensures progress saves every 100MB regardless of chunk size
  - Affects StandardStrategy and AdaptiveStrategy
- **UnboundLocalError crash**: Fixed variable scope issue in exception handlers
  - Initialize `device_id = None` at start of `wipe_device()` function
  - Prevents crashes when exceptions occur before device_id is assigned
- **Test infrastructure improvements**: Fixed 4 test mocking issues
  - Added missing `DeviceDetector` mocks in integration tests
  - Fixed `test_keyboard_interrupt_saves_actual_progress` device attribute
  - Added `input()` mock to prevent test hanging
  - All 157 tests now pass reliably

### Changed
- Test reliability: All tests properly mocked and isolated
- Code quality: Fixed whitespace and line length linter errors

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- **Critical: Keyboard interrupt progress loss**: Fixed bug where pressing Ctrl+C saved 0 bytes instead of actual progress
  - Exception handler now retrieves `strategy.written` before saving
  - Added `if 'strategy' in locals()` check for safety
  - Applies to both KeyboardInterrupt and general exceptions
- **Progress file flush**: Added immediate disk flush (`os.fsync()`) to ensure progress survives crashes
  - Python buffer flush + OS kernel flush for guaranteed persistence
  - Critical for interrupt and crash safety
- **Progress save frequency**: Increased from every 1GB to every 100MB
  - 10x improvement in progress tracking accuracy
  - Maximum lag reduced from 1GB to 100MB
- **Device mismatch on resume**: Program now halts immediately (sys.exit(1)) with clear error message when device ID doesn't match
  - Shows expected vs current serial/model/size
  - Provides step-by-step recovery instructions
  - Prevents accidental wiping of wrong drive
- **Test failure**: Fixed `test_wipe_with_progress_callback` to calculate expected callbacks dynamically

### Added
- **Enhanced resume diagnostics**: Added debug output to investigate resume detection issues
  - Full exception traceback in load_progress()
  - Dedicated RESUME STATUS section showing found/not-found status
  - Enhanced device identity warnings
- **Device unique ID verification**: Resume operations now verify device identity using serial, model, and size
  - `DeviceDetector.get_unique_id()` method added
  - Verifies correct drive before resuming wipe
  - Prevents accidental data loss from device swaps
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Added 8 new tests for keyboard interrupt and device verification
  - `test_keyboard_interrupt_saves_actual_progress`: Verifies interrupt saves actual progress

  - `test_get_unique_id`: Gets device identifiers
  - `test_get_unique_id_missing_fields`: Handles missing identifiers

### Changed
- **‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING**: Progress filename is now always `wipeit_progress.json` instead of `wipeit_progress_[device].json`
  - Simplifies progress tracking with single consistent filename
  - Note: Only one device can have active progress at a time
  - Old device-specific progress files will be ignored
- **Constant renamed**: `GB_MILESTONE_THRESHOLD` ‚Üí `PROGRESS_SAVE_THRESHOLD` for semantic clarity
  - Old name was misleading (value is 100MB, not GB)
  - New name is unit-agnostic and semantically accurate
- **Progress percent calculation**: Now accurately calculated and saved during interrupts
- **Icon usage**: Removed most decorative icons, keeping only `‚ö†Ô∏è` and `üö®` for critical warnings
  - Added strict icon usage guidelines to PROGRAMMING_STYLE_GUIDE.md
- **Test count**: Increased to 157 unit tests (up from 149)
- **Test coverage**: Maintained at 95%

### Technical
- **File I/O**: All progress saves now use `f.flush()` + `os.fsync()` for immediate disk persistence

  - `test_milestone_tracking`: Verifies milestones are tracked at 5% intervals

  - `test_estimated_finish_time_format`: Validates time format ("%I:%M %p")
  - `test_milestone_display_all_strategies`: Tests milestone display across StandardStrategy, SmallChunkStrategy, and AdaptiveStrategy
  - `test_milestone_uniqueness_all_strategies`: Verifies no duplicate milestones across all strategies
  - `test_milestone_initialization_on_resume`: Tests last_milestone calculation for various resume positions (0%, 12%, 47%, 5%, 99%)
  - `test_milestone_not_repeated_after_resume`: Verifies milestones aren't repeated when resuming from previous position
